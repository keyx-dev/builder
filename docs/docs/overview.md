# Overview

## What is `@keyx/builder`?

`@keyx/builder` is a powerful and flexible library designed for building dynamic user interfaces based on a tree structure of nodes. It provides the core components and utilities needed to define, manage, and render complex UI layouts programmatically.

## What can you use it for?

This library is ideal for scenarios where you need to:

- **Create drag-and-drop page builders or form builders:** Easily define and manipulate the structure of your application's UI through a visual interface.
- **Render dynamic content:** Display different UI elements based on data or user interactions without hardcoding layouts.
- **Build complex, nested components:** Manage hierarchical relationships between UI elements effectively.
- **Implement custom widget systems:** Define your own reusable UI components that can be integrated into the builder.
- **Serialize and deserialize UI structures:** Save and load your builder layouts to and from a data format.

## Key Features

- **Node-based structure:** Organize your UI as a tree of nodes, each representing a specific UI element or component.
- **Flexible rendering:** Easily map node types to your own React components for rendering.
- **Extensible:** Define custom widgets and logic to extend the builder's capabilities.
- **Data-driven:** Manage the state and properties of your UI elements through the node data.

This documentation will guide you through the process of using `@keyx/builder`, from understanding the core concepts to building your own custom solutions.
